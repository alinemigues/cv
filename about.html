    <h1>Background About Aline</h1>
    <p>In May 2017, I graduated from Louisiana State University with a major in
      Marketing with a concentration in Professional Sales and a minor in
      entrepreuneurship. While attending LSU, I was involved with Delta Delta Delta
      Soroity and was an intern at Otey White & Associates, an advertising an
      public relations firm. Upon graduation I accepted a full-time position with
      the Otey White & Associates as an Account Coordinator and Social Media Manager.
      I was presented the chance to buy media (print, tv, media, etc.) for
      NAPA Auto Parts. Along with managing and running campaigns on over 50
      NAPA Auto Parts FaceBook pages, I had the opportunity to explore copywriting
      with my own bi-monthly original content auto parts blog, for an NAPA Auto Care.

      After searching for another source of income, I began working as a Finanical
      Manager at Garrison & Associates Advertising and Public Relations in August 2017.
      As the finanical manager, I handled all billing, account payable, account
      receviable, etc. for clients such as McDonalds, CrimeStoppers, The Salvation
      Army.

      Looking for to explore the marketing field, in September 2017 I began
      working as an Account Executive at The Barnett Company, a promotional
      marketing company. This is where I met my mentor, Mandy, who might also
      be the smilest and kind person you would ever met. While we did promotional
      marketing, we also hosted company website that we held inventory on site to fulfill
      orders as they were received. I managed the Amedisys account, handling everything
      from designing the website to customer support to order processing to order
      fulfilling to inventory management to shipping/receiving to creating artwork
      to vendor communications to creating purchase orders to vendor billing and
      customer invoicing. We had a customized system in place for all clients with
      hosted company websites that was created using Microsoft Excel and
      Microsoft Access.This is where I truly became interested in web development.
